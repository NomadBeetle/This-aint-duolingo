# This Ain’t Duolingo 🇫🇷

A no-nonsense French flashcard app that actually respects your grind.
Made with Python and Tkinter — because gamified owls aren’t the only way to learn.

---

## Features

✅ Random French word flashcards
✅ Auto-flip to English in 3 seconds
✅ Smart progress tracker
✅ Reset progress anytime
✅ Images & UI that don’t burn your eyes

---

## How to Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NomadBeetle/this-aint-duolingo.git
cd this-aint-duolingo
python main.py
```

Make sure you keep the `data/` and `images/` folders as-is.
You’ll need Python installed (Tkinter comes preinstalled with most setups).
